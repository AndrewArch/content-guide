Avoid using italics.

Screen readers interpret italics in different ways.

Users with dyslexia can find italics very difficult to read.

Never use italics in headlines.

### Latin words

Instead of Latin words, use plain English where possible.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "avoiding italics"
  content= "
'He talked for a long time' instead of 'He talked _ad infinitum_'.
"
%}

An exception would be for scientific names.

Declare the language as Latin in the HTML so the screen reader will pronounce it correctly.
