Avoid using italics.

Screen readers interpret italics in different ways.

Users with dyslexia can find italics very difficult to read.

Never use italics in headlines.

### Latin words

Instead of Latin words, use plain English where possible.

An exception would be for scientific names.

Declare the language as Latin in the HTML so the screen reader will pronounce it correctly.
