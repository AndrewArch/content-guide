Avoid using italics.

Screen readers interpret italics in different ways. Users with dyslexia can find them very difficult to read.

Instead of Latin words, use plain English where possible.

{% include guide_example.liquid

'He talked for a long time' instead of 'He talked _ad infinitum_'.

An exception would be for scientific names.

Latin is a recognised language option and should be declared as such in the HTML in order for the screen reader to get the pronunciation right.

Never use italics in headlines.
