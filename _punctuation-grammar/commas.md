Use commas minimally.

Commas increase clarity because they bring in a natural pause.

Too many commas are a sign a sentence should be rewritten.

Don't use Oxford commas (a comma before the final ‘and’ or ‘or’ in a sentence).

Alternatively, shorten the sentence to 1 idea or use a [bullet point list](/content-structure/#bullet-point-lists).
