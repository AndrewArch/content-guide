Use commas minimally.

Commas are useful for enhancing clarity because they bring in a natural pause. But using too many can indicate too many words in the sentence. Try shortening your sentences instead.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "using commas"
  content= "
Like this

> After the proposal had been discussed at length in Cabinet, a media release was issued.

Or this

> The proposal, that was discussed in Cabinet, prompted a media release.

But not like this

> The proposal, was discussed at length in Cabinet and prompted a media release.

Or not like this

> The minister brought in 3 viewpoints and, she spoke to the whole team.

Don't use an Oxford comma (a comma before the final ‘and’ or ‘or’ in a sentence).

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "not using an Oxford comma"
  content= "

Alternatively, shorten the sentence to a 1 idea or use a [bullet point list]().
