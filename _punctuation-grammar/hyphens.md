Use hyphens when 2 or more words form an adjective, for example 'a first-class experience'.

Do not use hyphens when joining an adverb to a noun, for example 'highly intelligent'.

Some nouns are also hyphenated, for example about-face, air-conditioning. Check the [Macquarie Dictionary](https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/).

Login is not hyphenated.

Hyphens can change the meaning of a verb.

For example 'the group is going to re-form' or 'we need to reform the policy'.

Use a hyphen when the second word is ‘up’ (for example meet-up), or when the first and second word ends with the same letter (for example re-engage).
