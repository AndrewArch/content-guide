You can use an em dash with spaces to add a related idea to a sentence instead of creating a new sentence. Be careful the sentence does not become too long.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "em dash"
  content= "
Focus on user needs --- not government needs.

Write an em dash:

- Windows: hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> keys and type <kbd>-</kbd>
- Mac: hold <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> keys and type <kbd>-</kbd>
- [kramdown markdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) notation: use 3 hyphens (<kbd>---</kbd>)
- HTML: `&mdash;`
- Google Docs: go to 'Insert' menu and then 'Special characters'.
