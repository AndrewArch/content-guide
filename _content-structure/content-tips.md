### Write a clear title and lead summary

Tell the user what the page is about and who it's for.

### Write short paragraphs

Use short, simple paragraphs.

Try limiting to 2 or 3 sentences or break text up into bullet point lists to improve readability.

### Make your calls-to-action clear

Ensure your calls-to-action are visually prominent and contain user-friendly terms.
