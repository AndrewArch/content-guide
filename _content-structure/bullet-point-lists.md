Break up long sentences with lists, making it easier for your reader to understand and scan.

Bullet point lists break up the page and help with readability.

**REVIEW THIS: Only use a numbered list for ordered steps or to show priority.**

Use minimal punctuation and add a full stop after the final point. [Don't use a semicolon at the end of items]().
