# Privacy

This privacy policy outlines the personal information handling practices of the Guides team in the Digital Transformation Agency.

The Digital Transformation Agency has its own Privacy Statement that also applies.

The specific legal obligations of the Digital Transformation Agency when collecting and handling your personal information are outlined in the [Privacy Act 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00838) and in particular in the Australian Privacy Principles found in that Act.

We will update this privacy policy when our information handling practices change.

Updates will be published on our websites.

## How we use personal information

We collect, hold, use and disclose personal information to provide guidance and tools for the Australian Government to build simple, clear and fast services.

These functions and activities include:
- sharing code (UI-Kit) to build digital services
- providing guidance on building digital services (DTA Design Guide and DTA Content Guide)
- researching with users to improve our products
- providing training and presentations.

## Collection of personal information

We try to only collect the information we need for the particular function or activity we are carrying out.

The main way we collect personal information about you is when you give it to us.

For example, we collect contact details and feedback when you:
- post a comment in the Content Design in Government Google Group
- send to feedback to guides@digital.gov.au or content@digital.gov.au.

### Unsolicited personal information

We are sometimes given personal information that we have not asked for. This is called 'unsolicited personal information'.

When we receive 'unsolicited personal information' we comply with the requirements set out in APP 4.

### Sensitive information

We may indirectly collect information defined as 'sensitive information' in the Privacy Act. For example, disability details of users that we are researching with to improve our products.

We generally only collect and hold sensitive information with the consent of the relevant individual.

### Anonymity

Where possible, we will allow you to interact anonymously or using a pseudonym.

However, for some of our functions and activities we usually need your name and contact details.

### Collecting personal information through websites

We maintain several websites:

- UI-Kit
- DTA Design Guide
- DTA Content Guide.

We collect information, including submissions through email and the Content Design in Government Google Group, and information from user research.

We use this information to operate, manage and improve our websites and services.

We use repositories in GitHub (GitHub projects) to store and collaborate on the code used to build our websites and services.

Where our websites and GitHub projects allow you to make comments, log issues, make commits or collect feedback we collect your email address and/or username and sometimes other contact details (for example, details in your signature block).

We may use your email address and/or username to respond to your feedback.

[GitHub has its own Privacy Statement](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/).

The personal information handled by GitHub and Google is stored on servers across multiple countries.

### Analytic, session and cookie tools

We use a range of tools provided by third parties, such as Google Analytics, to collect or view website traffic information. These sites have their own privacy policies.

We also use cookies and session tools to improve your experience when accessing our websites.

The information collected by these tools may include the IP address of the device you are using and information about sites that IP address has come from, the pages accessed on our site and the next site visited. We use the information to maintain, secure and improve our websites and to enhance your experience when using them.

You can opt out of the collection of this information by Google Analytics using the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB).

### Hosting events

We use Eventbrite to facilitate registration and attendance at our events. When you register for an event using this service we might collect your personal information so we can facilitate your registration and attendance at the event. Eventbrite will handle your personal information and has its own privacy policy.

### User research

We use third-party services, such as Lookback, SurveyMonkey and OptimalSort, to help us research with users to improve our services. These services have their own privacy policies.

Where we collect personal information from users outside of the DTA we provide a consent form. The consent form details how the user's personal information will be handled.

## Disclosing your personal information and sensitive information

We only disclose your information (include sensitive information) for the purposes for which you gave it to us or for directly related purposes you would reasonably expect or if you agree.

The DTA discloses personal information to a number of service providers it users. The details of disclosure are specified in the DTA Privacy Policy under Section 4: 'Disclosing (sharing) your personal information and sensitive information'.

We are generally not likely to disclose personal information to a person (other than you) who is not in Australia or an external Territory. However:

- web traffic information is disclosed to Google Analytics when you visit our websites Google stores information across multiple countries
- when you provide feedback, log issues or create commits using GitHub the information is disclosed to GitHub.

Google and GitHub store information across multiple countries.

If you communicate with us your email service provider may store information in data centres outside of Australia. If you provide us with your email address you are authorising us to send your personal information to this address.

## Storing and security of your personal information

To help protect the privacy of data and personal information we collect and hold, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We follow the policies and procedures specified in the DTA Privacy Policy under Section 3: 'Holding your personal information'.

## Accessing and correcting your personal information

We try to make sure that personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, up-do-date and complete. follow the policies and procedures specified in the DTA Privacy Policy under Section 5: 'Rights and choices'.

## How to make a complaint

If you think that we have interfered with your privacy or otherwise breached our obligations under the APPs, you can make a complaint to us.

Any complaints should be in writing, setting out as much detail as possible, and addressed to our Privacy Officer.

We will take reasonable steps to investigate any complaint, and to notify you of the outcome of our investigation, within 30 days. We will assess and handle any complaints about the conduct of a DTA officer using the [APS Values](http://www.apsc.gov.au/aps-employment-policy-and-advice/aps-values-and-code-of-conduct/aps-values) and [APS Code of Conduct](http://www.apsc.gov.au/aps-employment-policy-and-advice/aps-values-and-code-of-conduct/code-of-conduct) and the [misconduct guidelines issues by the Australian Public Service Commission](http://www.apsc.gov.au/aps-employment-policy-and-advice/aps-values-and-code-of-conduct/handling-misconduct).
