# DTA Content Guide changelog

## Content Guide "Getting with the program"

### 1.0 - 2017-02-03

Live release of the DTA Content Guide.

Too much has changed since the <a href="https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-content-guide">draft Content Style Guide v1.0</a> was released in May 2016 to provide a detailed list.

The main changes are listed below.

#### IA and content streamlining

- Implementation of a completely new information architecture, based on card sorts with DTA content designers and members of the Content Design in Government Google Group.
- Removed repetition and outdated guidance.
- Improvement of content and rendering of examples in multiple sections.

#### New user interface and GitHub repo

- Implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit" rel="external">DTA's UI-Kit CSS framework</a>.
- A new <a href="https://github.com/govau/content-guide" rel="external>govau/content-guide</a> GitHub repository</a>.

#### Changes to guidance

- Updated guidance on [how to reference cultural diversity]() (TBC).
- [Capitalise Department and Minister](/punctuation-grammar/index.html#capitalisation) if it is a proper noun in all instances (TBC).
- Use [words for ordinals](/numbers-measurements/#numbers), except for dates.
- Added [guidance on referring to senators](/terms-phrases/#ministers-senators-mps).
- Use [Focused](/terms-phrases/#preferred-spellings), not focused.
- Programme, not program. No, we're just joking: we <a href="https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/news/view/editor/article/17/" rel="external">still recommend spelling it 'program' and here's why</a> (by the way, thanks for reading all the way to the bottom).
