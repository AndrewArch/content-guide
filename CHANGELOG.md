Live release of the DTA Content Guide.

Too much has changed since the <a href="https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-content-guide">draft Content Style Guide v1.0</a> was released in May 2016 to provide a detailed list.

The main changes are listed below.

### IA & content streamlining

- Implementation of a completely new information architecture, based on card sorts with DTA content designers and members of the Content Design in Government Google Group.
- Removed repetition and outdated guidance.
- Improvement of content and rendering of examples in multiple sections.

### New user interface & GitHub repo

- Implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit" rel="external">DTA's UI-Kit CSS framework</a>.
- A new <a href="https://github.com/govau/content-guide" rel="external">govau/content-guide</a> GitHub repository</a>.

### Changes to guidance

- Updated guidance on [how to reference cultural diversity](/accessibility-inclusivity/) (TBC).
- [Always capitalise Department and Minister if it is a proper noun](/punctuation-grammar/index.html#capitalisation) in all instances (TBC).
- Use [words for ordinals](/numbers-measurements/#numbers), except for dates.
- Added [guidance on referring to senators](/terms-phrases/#ministers-senators-mps).
- Use [focused](/terms-phrases/#preferred-spellings), not focussed.
- Programme, not program &#8212; no, we're joking. We still recommend you <a href="https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/news/view/editor/article/17/" rel="external">spell it 'program' and here's why</a> (and by the way, thanks for reading all the way to the bottom).
