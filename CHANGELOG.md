# DTA Content Guide changelog

## Content Guide 'Getting with the program'

### 1.0 - 2017-02-03

Live release of the DTA Content Guide.

The [draft Content Style Guide v1.0](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-content-guide) was released in May 2016. Too much has changed in this version to provide a complete list.

The main changes are listed below.

#### IA & content streamlining

- Implementation of a new information architecture, based on card sorts with DTA content designers and members of the Content Design in Government Google Group.
- Removed repetition and outdated guidance.
- Improvement of content and rendering of examples in multiple sections.

#### New user interface & GitHub repo

- Implementation of the [DTA's UI-Kit CSS framework](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit).
- A new [govau/content-guide](https://github.com/govau/content-guide) GitHub repository</a>.

#### Changes to guidance

- Updated guidance on [how to reference cultural diversity](/accessibility-inclusivity/) (TBC).
- [Capitalise Department and Minister](/punctuation-grammar/index.html#capitalisation) if it is a proper noun in all instances (TBC).
- Use [words for ordinals](/numbers-measurements/#numbers), except for dates.
- Added [guidance on referring to senators](/terms-phrases/#ministers-senators-mps).
- Use [focused](/terms-phrases/#preferred-spellings), not focused.
- Programme &mdash; no, we're joking. We follow the <a href="https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/">Macquarie Dictionary</a>'s recommendation to [spell it 'program'](/terms-phrases/#preferred-spellings). You can read the <a href="https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/news/view/editor/article/17/">Macquarie Dictionary editor's thoughts about 'programme or program?'</a>.
