Use Australian English spelling (‘ise’ rather than ‘ize’), except when referring to the names of specific organisations, such as the World Health Organization.

Use the most recent edition of the [Macquarie Dictionary](https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/), and the first option listed.

The default Microsoft Word spell checker setting is US English, which differs from Australian English.

The English UK setting uses spellings that are more similar to Australian English.
