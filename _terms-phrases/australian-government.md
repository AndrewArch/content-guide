Use 'Australian Government' when talking about the national government of Australia.

Don't use 'Government', 'Commonwealth Government' or 'federal government'.

Only use the â€˜Commonwealth of Australiaâ€™ when talking about the legal entity established by the Constitution.

The words government, group, parliament, state and territory are only capitalised in a formal title.
