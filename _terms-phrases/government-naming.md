### Australian Government

Use 'Australian Government' when talking about the national government of Australia. Don't use 'Government', 'Commonwealth Government' or 'federal government'.

Only use the ‘Commonwealth of Australia’ when talking about the legal entity established by the Constitution.

The words government, group, parliament, state and territory are only capitalised as part of a formal title.
