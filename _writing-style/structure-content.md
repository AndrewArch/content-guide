[Structure content](/content-structure/) to put the user first, with clear purpose and focus on outcome.

- Design your content to lead the user to the information they need.
- Write for mobile screen sizes first --- make it easy for users to scroll through content on a screen. Users prefer to scroll rather than click.
- Write short sentences and paragraphs (2 sentences containing only 1 idea). Allow for lots of white space.
- Break up text with [bullet point lists](/az-indexes/b.html#bullet-point-lists).
- Use [relevant keywords](/content-structure/#headings-subheadings) early in headings, sentences and links to make content easier to find and navigate.
- Use [calls-to-action](/content-structure/#hyperlinks) to help the user get what they need done.
