You need to think differently about how you may normally write, even if you are a digital native.

- Write in plain English so the user can understand regardless of their ability.
- Use active voice.
- Write for mobile screen sizes first and make it easy for users to scroll through content on a screen. Users prefer to scroll rather than click.
- Keep words to a minimum and allow for lots of white space.
- Write short sentences and paragraphs (2 sentences containing only 1 idea).
- Minimise punctuation. Use several short sentences instead of a long sentence broken up with punctuation.
- Write like the user talks: leave out jargon and government speak.
- Break up text with [bullet point lists](/az-indexes/b.html#bullet-point-lists).
- Use relevant keywords early in sentences, headings and links to make content easier to find and navigate.
- Make sure that your content is up to date and shows that interacting with government can be easy.
