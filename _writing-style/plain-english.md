When you write in plain English you make content easy to understand for everyone, regardless of their ability.

- Write less and structure content around the needs of the user.
- Avoid jargon so the user can understand the first time they read the content.
- Use active voice, not passive.
- Choose the [shorter plain English word, term, sentence and paragraph]() over the longer.
- Think about the [needs of users who speak a language other than English]().
