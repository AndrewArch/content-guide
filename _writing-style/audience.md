You should write so everyone can understand. But your content will be more effective if you understand the specific needs of your user.

You need find out:

- how the user behaves and what they're interested in or worried about --- so your writing will catch their attention and answer their questions
- the user's vocabulary --- so that you can use the same terms and phrases they'll use to search for content.
