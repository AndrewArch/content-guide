Use active voice (subject-verb-object). Active voice gets straight to the point.

Avoid passive voice (object-verb-subject). It usually makes it difficult to know who did what to whom and sends the reader backwards.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "using active voice"

Like this

> - The committee (subject) campaigned (verb) to lower diabetes (object).
> - We (subject) did not accept (verb) your application (object).

Not this

> - The lowering of diabetes was campaigned for by the committee.
> - It was deemed your application was unsuccessful.

Try using the first and second person (we, us) instead of the third person to help you to write in the active voice.

You can use passive voice if there is no do-er.

### Contractions

Use contractions carefully to be more conversational.

Remember that low-literacy users and people with English as another language may find contractions difficult to understand.

Avoid less common colloquial contractions like you'd.

Always consider the context. Avoid using contractions where a user may misunderstand what they are being asked to do, for example in a form.

### -ings (gerunds)

Avoid using a gerund (-ings) where possible, for more concise language.

**For example**
