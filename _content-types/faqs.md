Avoid using FAQs (frequently asked questions).

FAQs date easily and suggest that web content is out of touch with the user's needs.

Answers to important questions should sit naturally in context on a website, where users expect to find them.

Question why you need FAQs. If they are essential make sure they are useful, well-edited and link directly to the places the user needs.

FAQs need to be regularly updated through feedback loops and grouped under topics for quick reference.
