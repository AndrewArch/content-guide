We discourage FAQs (frequently asked questions). They date easily and suggest that the website information is out of touch with its usersâ€™ needs.

Answers to important questions should sit naturally in context on a website, where users expect to find them.

Question why you need FAQs. If they are essential make sure they are useful, well-edited and link to relevant information.  

FAQs need to be regularly updated through feedback loops and grouped under topics for quick reference.
