Think about the user when you write the script.

Get to the point early on.

Think visually and show don’t tell. What you show on the video should describe what is being said to reduce the narrative.

### Make short videos

People prefer videos that are around 2-3 minutes long.

The longer a video gets, the harder it is to keep people engaged.

### Accessible videos

Create accessible videos by providing:
- closed captions added in video post-production --- to articulate what is said or heard
- audio narration (where someone narrates the script) --- for people who cannot see the screen
- an alternative version, such as a text transcript available in HTML --- for those who choose to read and not watch.

Think about all access issues:

- visual impairment
- hearing impairment
- mobility --- restricted keyboard access
- flickering and moving content
- language difficulty
- non-conducive environments, for example a noisy environment or a workplace where the sound disturbs colleagues.

### Provide a transcript

Add the HTML transcript to the same page as the video. Or add a link below or beside the video to a page with the transcript.

Include all speech content and the speakers' names.

If there is only 1 speaker you can leave out their name, unless their identity is crucial to the content.

Write relevant non-verbal information in square brackets.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "writing non-verbal information in transcript"
  content= "
‘...to get to the other side [laughing].’
"
%}

End the transcript with 'End of transcript'.
