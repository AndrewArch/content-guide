[Make videos accessible to the user](/accessibility-inclusivity/#video-and-transcripts).

Think about the user when you write the script.

Get to the point early on.

Think visually. Show, donâ€™t tell. What you show on the video should describe what is being said to reduce the narrative.

### Make short videos

People prefer videos that are around 2-3 minutes long.

The longer a video gets, the harder it is to keep people engaged.
