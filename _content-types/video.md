People prefer videos that are around 2-3 minutes long. The longer a video, the harder it is to keep people engaged.

Write the script with your audience in mind and get to the point early on.

Think visually. What you show on the video should describe what is being said to reduce the narrative. Show don’t tell.

### Accessible videos

Create accessible videos using:
- closed captions (in video post-production) to articulate what is said or heard
- audio narration (where someone narrates the script) for people who cannot see the screen
- an alternative version for those who choose to read and not watch, such as a text transcript available in HTML.

Make sure access is taken into account for:

- visual impairment
- hearing impairment
- mobility --- restricted keyboard access
- flickering and moving content
- language difficulty
- non-conducive environments, for example a noisy environment or a workplace where the sound disturbs colleagues.

### Transcripts

Add the HTML transcript to the same page as the video. Alternatively, link to a separate page from immediately below or beside the video itself.

Include all speech content.

Include the speakers' names. If there is only 1 speaker it’s generally not necessary to include their name, unless their identity is crucial to the content.

Only include relevant non-verbal information in square brackets.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "writign non-verbal information in transcript"
  content= "
‘...to get to the other side [laughing].’
"
%}

End the transcript with 'End of transcript'.
