Write forms in in plain English.

Think about the user’s need and what you want them to achieve.

Call the form something which explains the task. Include a short description.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "titling a form"
  content= "
Title: School enrolment form

Brief description: Enrol your child in a NSW public school.
"
%}

Be helpful. If extra documents are required to complete the form, list them with a subheading.

**For example**
{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "listing documents for a form"
  content= "
To complete this form you need:

- driver’s licence
- passport
- birth certificate
- utilities bill.
"
%}

If you are collecting personal details, include a sentence to explain why. Link to your privacy statement.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "information about collecting personal details"
  content= "
We will not collect, use or store your personal data for any purpose other than as stated in this form.

See our [privacy statement]().

Test forms for usability and accessibility.

If a form will be printed, scanned or emailed, provide a contact support phone number on the form.

### Surveys & questionnaires

Make surveys accessible. Keep them short and relevant.

Use the title to remind the user what they are being asked about.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "referencing a PDF"
  content= "
Title: School canteen survey

Brief description: Have your say about our proposed new canteen menu.
"
%}

Say how long the survey will take to complete.

Avoid ambiguity in questions.

Provide a short explanation of why you are asking each question.

If you use a open-ended question think how you will report on that data.
