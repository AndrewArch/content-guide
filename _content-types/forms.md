Forms must be written using simple language in plain English.

Think about the user’s need and what you want them to achieve.

Call the form something which explains the task and add a short description.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "titling a form"
  content= "
Title: School enrolment form

Brief description: Enrol your child in a NSW public school.
"
%}

Be helpful. If extra documents are required to complete the form, offer a list under a subheading.

**For example**
{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "listing documents for a form"
  content= "
What you need to complete this form:

- driver’s licence
- passport
- birth certificate
- utilities bill.
"
%}

If you are collecting personal details, include a sentence to explain why.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "information about collecting personal details"
  content= "
We will not collect, use or store your personal data for any purpose other than as stated in this form. See our privacy statement.
"
%}

Forms should be tested for usability and accessibility.

If a form is to be and printed, scanned or emailed, provide a contact support phone number alongside the PDF.

### Surveys & questionnaires

Make surveys accessible. Keep them short and relevant.

Use the title to remind the user what they are being asked about.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "referencing a PDF"
  content= "
Title: School canteen survey

Brief description: Have your say about our proposed new canteen menu.
"
%}

Indicate how long it will take to complete.

Questions are deceptively hard to write.

A good question has no ambiguity and is accompanied by a short explanation of why you are asking it.

When using an open-ended question consider how you are going to report on that data.
