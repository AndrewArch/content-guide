### Microsoft Word

Word documents should never be published on the web as a standalone piece of information.

Instead consider if the information can be presented as a HTML web page, or if really necessary as a PDF.

If you need to send out a Word document as an email attachment, for example, you must make your Word document accessible to everyone. This includes people who rely on assistive technologies, such as screen readers.

Microsoft Word formats (`.doc` and `.docx`) do not currently conform to WCAG 2.0 when viewed on mobile devices.

### Google Docs

Google Docs is designed to work well with screen readers and assistive technologies.
