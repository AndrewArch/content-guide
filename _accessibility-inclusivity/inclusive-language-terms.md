Avoid discriminatory language that treats some people differently from others.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "inclusive terms"
  content= "
- People with disability --- not people with a disability or disabled or handicapped people.
- Intellectually impaired --- not intellectually disabled.
- Hearing impaired --- not deaf.
- Visually impaired --- not blind.
- Older people or seniors --- not pensioners or old-age pensioners or the aged.
- Young people --- not youth or juveniles.
- First Australians or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples (note the plural) --- not ATSI, Aborigines or Aboriginals.

Speak to the person (in plain English, without jargon) rather than speaking to their difference. This avoids getting caught up in semantics and is respectful of:

- disability
- cultural differences
- differences in socioeconomic background
- differences in educational levels and systems
- generational differences
- gender roles
- perceptions of social and support concepts
- political impacts on life events
- pre and post effects of wars
- religious affiliations
- values or philosophical differences.

### Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples specifics

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples represent a diverse range of cultures and are not 1 homogenous group.

Within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples/nations are many distinct cultural groups.

English is a second, third or even fourth language for many First Australians.

  content= "
Do not use:

- Aboriginals, Aborigine --- these words are associated with colonisation and assimilation and are distressing to many people
- ATSI --- never use the acronym ATSI as this is considered disrespectful
- Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Australians.

Instead use:

- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples (note the plural)
- Aboriginal peoples (note the plural)
- Torres Strait Islander peoples (note the plural)
- Aboriginal man/woman/child
- Aboriginal Elder
- First Australians.

#### ‘Indigenous’

While it is Australian Government practice to refer to Indigenous Australians, this is not preferred by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

Find an alternative to using Indigenous when you can, especially when referring to individuals.

Ideally use the local language group name. The <a href="http://austlang.aiatsis.gov.au/main.php">Australian Indigenous Languages Database</a> from AIATSIS may help you identify the local language.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "alternatives to using Indigenous"

If you are sure use:

> The Ngunnawal woman spoke first.

If you are unsure, use:

> The Aboriginal woman spoke first.

Not:

> The Indigenous woman spoke first.

Indigenous is the common term when referring to a business entity or business function.

### Languages other than English

Make sure your content can be understood by someone who speaks English as a second, third or fourth language.

Content should also be culturally sensitive to people who come from different cultures and may have different experiences with, and expectations of, dealing with government

#### Translation

Consider whether the information should also be provided in appropriate community languages. This can be helpful if there are compliance requirements.

Selecting the appropriate language for translation requires research into user needs. Don’t just pick the top languages spoken at home, or another simple metric, as these can be misleading about the audiences’ real needs.

Content written in plain English is easier to translate (and read).

Translating is not just about the words. It’s also about capturing the meaning of what you are communicating within the context of a culture.

If your content needs to be translated, best practice is for this to be undertaken by <a href="https://www.naati.com.au/" rel="external">NAATI-accredited translators</a> and independently checked by another accredited translator.
