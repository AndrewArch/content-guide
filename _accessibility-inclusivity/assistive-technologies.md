People use different combinations of assistive technology and adaptive strategies to use government services.

The most common assistive technologies are screen readers, screen magnifiers, voice recognition and keyboard navigation.

### Screen readers

Screen readers are an assistive technology that helps users who are blind or visually impaired.

Screen readers read the content of the web page in a linear fashion and help the user navigate the page

#### Clear writing helps users of all technology

[Clear writing](/writing-style/) helps users with screen readers by making content easier to understand and to skim. It gives all users a better experience, regardless of ability.

Keep sentences short so the meaning is concise. This means the screen reader won't need to read out a lot of punctuation.

Not all screen readers work the same and some can miss nuances in longer sentences.

#### Screen readers navigate using headings, links and tags

Screen readers can index headings, links and tags to give users an overview of a web page and enable them to navigate by these elements.

Use [hierarchical headings](/content-structure/#headings-subheadings) and [links that can be understood on their own](/content-structure/#hyperlinks) rather than relying on the context of surrounding text. [Meaningful image alt text and captions](#images-and-alt-text) are also important.
