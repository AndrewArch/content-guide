Make sure your content can be understood by someone who speaks English as a second, third or fourth language.

Consider whether the information should also be provided in appropriate community languages. This can be helpful if there are compliance requirements.

Do not use the terms CALD (culturally and linguistically diverse) or EAL/D (English as an additional language or dialect).

### Translation

Content written in plain English is easier to translate (and read).

Translating is not just about the words. Itâ€™s also about capturing the meaning of what you are communicating within the context of a culture.

If your content needs to be translated, best practice is for this to be undertaken by [NAATI-accredited translators](https://www.naati.com.au/) and independently checked by another accredited translator.

See the Department of Social Services [Multicultural Language Services Guidelines for Australian Government Agencies](https://www.dss.gov.au/settlement-and-multicultural-affairs/programs-policy/multicultural-access-and-equity/multicultural-access-and-equity-resources).

Where a [PDF version of content](#pdfs) needs to be made available in another language, publish the PDFs with a plain English version in HTML.
