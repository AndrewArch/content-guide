Screen readers are an assistive technology that helps users who are blind or visually impaired.

The assistive technology reads what is on a screen and helps the user navigate the page.

[Clear writing](/writing-style/) gives your users a better experience when using a screen reader.

Keep sentences short so the meaning is concise. This means the screen reader won't need to read out a lot of punctuation. Not all screen readers work the same and some can miss nuances in longer sentences.

Screen readers can index headings, links and tags to give users an overview of a web page.

It is important to use [hierarchical headings](/content-structure/#headings-subheadings), [links that are embedded in useful text](/content-structure/#hyperlinks) and [meaningful image alt text and captions](#images-alt-text).

This approach to writing gives all users a better experience, regardless of ability.
