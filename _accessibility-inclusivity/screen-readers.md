Screen readers are an assistive technology that helps users who are blind or visually impaired.

People use screen readers to understand web pages through a combination of:
- reading the content of the web page in a linear order
- moving around the page through the links and headings.

### Clear writing helps all users

Write clearly and use plain English. This helps users with screen readers by making content easier to understand and to skim.

Keep sentences short so the meaning is concise. This means the screen reader won't need to read out a lot of punctuation. Not all screen readers work the same and some can miss nuances in longer sentences.

### Headings, links and tags help screen readers navigate

Screen readers can index web page headings, links and tags to create an overview that people can use to navigate.

Make web pages easier to navigate for screen readers using:

- [hierarchical headings](/content-structure/#headings-and-subheadings)
- [precise links](/content-structure/#hyperlinks) that can be understood on their own without the context of surrounding text
- meaningful [image alt text and captions](#images-and-alt-text).
