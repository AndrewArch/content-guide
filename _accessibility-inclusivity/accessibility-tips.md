- Use hierarchical headings `H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `H4` for page structure with meaningful text.
- Use [bullet point lists](/az-indexes/b.html#bullet-point-lists) where possible.
- Write [link text](/az-indexes/h.html#hyperlinks) that makes sense out of context.
- Make sure there is sufficient contrast between any text and the background.
- Use dot, dashes and patterns in graphs in addition to colour for differentiating different data.
- Provide alt text for images.
- Provide [transcripts]() and [captions]() for video and audio.
- Avoid jargon and limit contractions.
- Follow the WAI's [Tips for Getting Started with Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/tips/) and [Tips on Writing for Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/tips/writing.html).
