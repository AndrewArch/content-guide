Videos must have:
- transcripts for reading by people who don’t want to watch the video and for search engine indexing
- closed captions for people who can’t hear the dialogue and other sounds
- audio descriptions as appropriate for people who can’t see the video.

Audio description is not necessary for only dialogue delivered straight to camera ('talking heads'). But you must still provide audio description for any text displayed in the video. Also, use audio description to set the scene and giving context if this is not obvious from the title.

### Think about all access issues for video

- Visual impairment.
- Hearing impairment.
- Mobility --- restricted keyboard access.
- Flickering and moving content.
- Language difficulty.
- Non-conducive environments, for example a noisy environment or a workplace where the sound disturbs colleagues.

### Provide a transcript

Add the HTML transcript to the same page as the video. Or add a link below or beside the video to a page with the transcript.

Include all speech content and the speakers' names.

If there is only 1 speaker you can leave out their name, unless their identity is crucial to the content.

Write relevant non-verbal information in square brackets.

{% include guide_example.liquid
  title = "writing non-verbal information in transcript"
  content= "
‘...to get to the other side [laughing].’
"
%}

End the transcript with 'End of transcript'.
